# CV And Gate Ranges

### All CV inputs respond to -5 V…+5 V. Every knob is treated as an offset: with the knob at 50%, a -5 V signal will turn it all the way left, and a +5 V signal will turn it all the way right. All logic outputs are 0-5v. The button logic inputs are rising edge triggers and ignore pulse width. All Quantized outputs are scaled for 1v/octave pitch tracking.

# Key and Mode 

<img src="https://github.com/moffenzeefmodular/VCVrack-submission/blob/main/doc/images/KleztizerKeyMode.png" width="500">

The **Key** and **Mode** parameters dictate the root pitch and the associated musical mode to which the chord and lead sections assign their scales.

* **KEY:** Select the root pitch of the musical mode in semitones over a single octave.  
* **MODE:** Select the musical mode (in order): Freygish, Mi Sheberach, Adonai Malakh, Magein Avot, Harmonic Minor.

# Chords 

<img src="https://github.com/moffenzeefmodular/VCVrack-submission/blob/main/doc/images/KleztizerChords.png" width="500">

Inspired by the Omnichord and many unusual organs from the 70s and 80s, this button interface selects the chord triad of the associated scale degree in each musical mode. The chords change based on the settings of **Key** and **Mode**. Depending on the musical **Mode** selected, when playing a traditional melody or sending voltages into the **Lead** sections, some chords might sound "correct" while others may not. Since we're in a modular environment and the concept of melody and meter is somewhat flexible, I'll leave that up to you to decide.

* **CHORD SELECT BUTTONS:** Select the chord triad corresponding to the chosen scale degree.  
* **BUTTON TRIGGER INPUTS:** Directly trigger a chord selection with a gate or trigger.  
* **CHORD CV INPUT:** A bipolar CV input for selecting a chord.  
* **VOICING:** This knob shifts the voice allocation for the highest and lowest pitches of the triad: Closed (normal triad), Drop 2 (2nd note is one octave down), Drop 3 (3rd note is one octave down), Open (1st note is one octave down, 3rd note is one octave up).  
* **INVERSION:** This inverts the chord after the **Voicing** has been selected in the following order: Root (no inversion), 1st (lowest note becomes highest), and 2nd (highest note becomes lowest). Although inverting chords after changing the **Voicing** can sometimes yield the same musical results as adjusting the **Voicing** knob itself, this knob acts as a way to modulate around a **Voicing** home base that you like.

# Lead Channels 
<img src="https://github.com/moffenzeefmodular/VCVrack-submission/blob/main/doc/images/KleztizerLead.png" width="500">

There are two **Lead** channels in Kleztizer that behave identically. The **Lead** channels are quantizers that adjust their scale and root pitch based on the **Key** and **Mode** parameters. Within those settings, the user can choose where the quantizer scale starts using **Note Offset**. They can modify the overall note range with **CV Amount** and transpose the final result with the **Octave** switch. Each time a new note is generated by the quantizer, a logic signal is generated at the **Trig/Gate** output. This logic output is intended for triggering an amplitude envelope. The idea is that you can send a nonlinear voltage source, such as an LFO, into the quantizer and trigger discrete notes each time the quantizer outputs a new note.

* **NOTE OFFSET:** Sets the starting scale degree of the quantizer. It has an overall range of -2…+2 V, corresponding to -2 to +2 octaves from the designated root pitch.  
* **CV:** A voltage attenuator pre-quantizer that limits the overall note range of the **Lead**.  
* **OCT.:** An octave transpose post-quantizer that shifts the sequence an additional -2 or +2 octaves.  
* **TRIG/GATE:** Changes the behavior of the **TRIG/GATE** logic output. In **Trig** mode, a short 5 ms pulse is triggered each time a new note is generated. In **Gate** mode, a 50% gate is generated for the duration between the previous note and the new note.  
* **TRIG/GATE OUTPUT:** The logic output for the **Lead** sections.

# Quantizer Outputs

<img src="https://github.com/moffenzeefmodular/VCVrack-submission/blob/main/doc/images/KleztizerOutputs.png" width="500">

The outputs at the bottom of the module provide the quantized notes from both the **Chord** and **Lead** sections. These outputs connect to 1 V/Oct inputs on oscillators to produce musical pitches.

* **PEDAL:** Outputs a steady note that matches the **Key** knob, intended as a drone for the selected key. It is only affected by the **Key** knob and does not change with any other settings.  
* **BASS:** Outputs the tonic of the current **Chord**, one octave below the other chord outputs. It is unaffected by **Voicing** and **Inversion**.  
* **1/POLY:** Can be used as a polyphonic output for all three chord voices or independently as the first voice in the chord.  
* **2:** The second voice of the selected chord, affected by **Voicing** and **Inversion**.  
* **3:** The third voice of the selected chord, affected by **Voicing** and **Inversion**.  
* **LEAD 1:** The quantized output of **Lead 1**.  
* **LEAD 2:** The quantized output of **Lead 2**.
